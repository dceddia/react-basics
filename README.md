# react-basics
A few starter projects to learn the basics of React.

Each of these projects was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so it's easy to get started.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` from inside the project directory (colors, counter, or hello-world)
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the code.
